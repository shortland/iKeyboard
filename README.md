iKeyboard
=========

Pure CSS, JS and HTML Mobile Keyboard.

  This project is inactive.
  - Layout formatting ect needs work, compatible on iPhone 6 Screen size only.
  - Overall needs speed improvement as-well, unable to type 'fast'.
  - Feel free to take a look, it uses "JQuery".
  

  <b>UPDATE:</b>

Basically redid all the code; simple, flat out, to the point.

Removed dependency on LocalStorage.

More dependent on jQuery.
